# Hello-World
Writing code is my new passion.  Ever since my humble beginnings writing BASIC programs I knew that this was something that I want to develop.  I have experience with Basic, Visual Basic, Fox Pro, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java.  At the moment I have been focusing at front end development, but would like to explore mobile/andriod development
